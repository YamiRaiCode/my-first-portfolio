# Personal Portfolio Website 🐙

I'm so happy to share my first portfolio website. I'm still a beginner in web development, but I have done several projects that I'm proud of. So I wanted to share my work in one place with you. 🧡

### Description 🦑

This is my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my skills and projects which I made as a web developer. The site is built using jQuery and includes a variety of features, such as:

* A main section with an overview of my information,
* A projects section with links to my work and skills,
* A contact page where visitors can get in touch with me.

### Used Technologies 🦀

The following technologies were used to build this website:

* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) 
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 

##### I never gave up, and I'm still learning.🐬
